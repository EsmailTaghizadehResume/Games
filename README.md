# Tic Tac Toe 🕹️

In American English, the game 🎮 is known as "tic-tac-toe".

In Commonwealth English (particularly British, South African, Australian and New Zealand English), the game 🎮 is known as "noughts and crosses". This name derives 
from the shape of the marks in the game 🎮 (i.e the X and O); "nought" is an older name for the number zero, while "cross" refers to the X shape. While the term 
nought is now less commonly used, the name "noughts and crosses" is still preferred over the American name "tic-tac-toe" in these countries.

# Tic Tac Toe : History

Games 🎮 played on three-in-a-row boards can be traced back to ancient Egypt, where such game boards have been found on roofing tiles dating from around 1300 BC.

An early variation of tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called terni lapilli (three pebbles at a time) and instead of 
having any number of pieces, each player had only three; thus, they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing. The game's 🎮 grid markings have been
found chalked all over Rome. Another closely related ancient game is three men's morris which is also played on a simple grid and requires three pieces in a row to 
finish, and Picaria, a game 🎮 of the Puebloans.

The different names of the game are more recent. The first print reference to "noughts and crosses" (nought being an alternative word for 'zero'), the British name, appeared in 1858, in an issue of Notes and Queries. The first print reference to a game called "tick-tack-toe" occurred in 1884, but referred to "a 
children's game played on a slate, consisting of trying with the eyes shut to bring the pencil down on one of the numbers of a set, the number hit being scored".
"Tic-tac-toe" may also derive from "tick-tack", the name of an old version of backgammon first described in 1558. The US renaming of "noughts and crosses" to "tic-
tac-toe" occurred in the 20th century.

In 1952, OXO (or Noughts and Crosses), developed by British computer scientist Sandy Douglas for the EDSAC computer at the University of Cambridge, became one of
the first known video games 🎮. The computer player could play perfect games of tic-tac-toe against a human opponent.

In 1975, tic-tac-toe was also used by MIT students to demonstrate the computational power of Tinkertoy elements. The Tinkertoy computer, made out of (almost) only
Tinkertoys, is able to play tic-tac-toe  perfectly. It is currently on display at the Museum of Science, Boston.
